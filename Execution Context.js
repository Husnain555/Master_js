// In the execution context, there are two portions: one is called the memory component, and the other is called the code component.
//
//     The memory component, also known as the variable environment, stores all objects and function objects in a key-value pair format.
//
//     The code component is where JavaScript executes these objects and functions line by line. This is why JavaScript is called an asynchronous language.
